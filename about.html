    <h2>Professional Narrative</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>John Christian Estay</strong>, an aspiring IT student with a strong interest in
        software development, networking, and problem-solving. I aim to apply my technical knowledge
        to real-world systems and continuously grow as a technology professional.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages,
        database management, and IT support. My passion for technology drives me to explore new tools,
        frameworks, and methodologies that can enhance efficiency and innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a student athlete, I have learned the importance of discipline, time management, and teamwork—
        qualities that I bring to every project I undertake. I am committed to leveraging my technical
        skills and collaborative mindset to contribute meaningfully to the IT industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        My career goal is to become a well-rounded IT professional capable of designing, implementing,
        and maintaining robust technological solutions. I am eager to learn from industry experts,
        participate in challenging projects, and continue my growth in this ever-evolving field.
